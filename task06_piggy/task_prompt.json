    "self.piggy = self.scene.add_entity(morph=gs.morphs.Mesh(filename='piggy.obj', pos=(0.2, 0.2, 0.01), euler=(90, 0, 90)))",
    "TIPS_FOR_DESIGNER": "The piggy bank has a smooth surface and cannot be grasped directly. You could consider lifting it up by inserting a thin object into the insertion hole on top of it. The insertion hole is 0.6cmx4.4cm, and the piggy bank is 0.2m high."
