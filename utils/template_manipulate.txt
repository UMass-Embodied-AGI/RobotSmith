Now you have a robotic task: 

On the table, there is a robot arm with a parallel gripper, $3D_OBJECT_DESCRIPTION$. The task goal is to $GOAL_DESCRIPTION$. For more detailed scene setup, here is a code:

$3D_CONFIGURATION$

You have already designed a tool for the task. The detailed shape and placement info can be reffered to chat history. Now you need to provide a robotic manipulation trajectory using the following 3 APIs:

```python
adjust_gripper_pose(pos, quat) # move the gripper to target pose
grasp(obj, grasp_quat) # auto calculate a grasping pose to steadily grasp obj up while keep the given grasp_quat
release() # open the gripper to the widest
```
